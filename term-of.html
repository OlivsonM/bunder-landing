        </h2>
        <h3 class="term_title">
            Keep communication constructive.
        </h3>
        <p class="term_regular">Communication should be appropriate for recipients of all age levels and constructive in
            nature, so we encourage you to carefully consider all message content before sending.
        </p>
        <p class="term_regular">Messages on Bunder can't be edited or deleted, and everyone can download a complete

            Make sure your participant list is current and accurate.
        </h3>
        <p class="term_regular">To make sure you're connecting to the people you intend to connect, check your world
            list frequently and remove anyone who shouldn't be in your world. </p>
        <p class="term_regular">Anyone who has access to your world can request information on the members of your world
            or a complete merge with you, so be careful about choosing the people to engage with it on social media or
            other public platforms.
        </p>
        <h3 class="term_title">Connect with people you know.
        </h3>
        <p class="term_regular">Before you merge worlds or accept an invitation, take a second to make sure you
            recognize the requestee. If you merge worlds by mistake, you cannot leave at any time.
        </p>

            actions.</p>
        <h3 class="term_title">Send useful, relevant messages. </h3>
        <p class="term_regular">While every community is different, each action you make should be valuable for your
            participants. Listen to
            feedback from your peers about the relevance, frequency, and accuracy of your responses. If you find that
            your messages are important for only a specific person, consider creating a private conversation with them.
        </p>
        <h2 class="term_title">To help keep our community safe, avoid the following:</h2>
        <h3 class="term_title">Profanity. </h3>
        <p class="term_regular">Don't use words and phrases that you wouldn't say over in public. Keep it clean. Bunder
            is first and foremost a tool for mutually beneficial networking.
